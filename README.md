# Belly_Button_Biodiversity
Module 12 Challenge

## Project Overview

### Bacteria to Beef?

Research is under way to discover and document potentially unknown bacteria that could synthesize proteins for the production of synthetic beef. The company, Improbable Beef, is looking for bacteria that may synthesize proteins that taste more like beef than previous attempts with algae, fungi, and plant root microorganisms. After researching bacteria, they think that a good candidate may be found in the human belly button area. This dashboard was designed for donors and scientists at the company to explore the various species found on the donors.
